        <p>Shahriar Chowdhury Emon[2] (Bangla: শাহরিয়ার চৌধুরী ইমন; September 19th 1971 - September 6th 1996), known by his stage name Salman Shah, was a Bangladeshi film and television actor. Commonly regarded as one of the most iconic actors in Bangladesh's film history,[3] Shah appeared in 27 films in a short acting career of three years.[4] His first feature film Keyamat Theke Keyamat (1993) shot him to stardom.[5] In the following two years Shah appeared in leading roles in a series of commercially successful films, including Bikkhobh, Denmohor, Shujon Shokhi, Shopner Thikana, Ei Ghor Ei Shongsar, Sotter Mrittu Nei and Anondo Osru.[6]

            At the height of his fame, Shah was found dead in his apartment in Eskaton, Dhaka on September 6, 1996.[7] After decades of controversy and speculation around his death,[8][9][10] Police Buerau of investigation of Bangladesh ruled the cause of his death as suicide in 2021.[11][12][13]
            
            Early life and career
            Shah was born Shahriar Chowdhury Emon on 19 September 1971 in Zakiganj, Sylhet, Bangladesh, to Nilufar Zaman Chowdhury and Kamaruddin Chowdhury.[4] He had a younger brother named Chowdhury Mohammad Shahran Evan.[14]
            
            Shah first appeared in public television in 1985 as a model for a music video produced by Hanif Sanket.[15] He later worked on several commercials and a small part in a TV drama. Shah made his acting debut in 1993 with the movie Keyamat Theke Keyamat along with another debutant actress Moushumi. Directed by Sohanur Rahman Sohan'[16][17], the film was a remake of a Bollywood film Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). Keyamat theke Keyamat became an instant hit and established Shah as a romantic lead actor in Dhalliwood.[18] The success of the Salman-Moushumi "romantic duo" led to their casting in three more feature films Ontare Ontare, Denmohor and Sneho.[5][19] Later, Shah co-starred with actress Shabnur in a number of commercially successful films including Shopner Thikana and Anondo Osru.[20]
            
            Death

            Salman Shah died on 6 September 1996.[22] He was found hanging from the ceiling of his bedroom at Eskaton, Dhaka.[23] Police had filed a case of suicide, but the family objected to it and lodged a murder case.[24] Business tycoon Aziz Mohammad Bhai was alleged to be involved in the murder.[25] One Rezvi Ahmed was arrested from the house of Shah's mother, who reportedly named Bhai and Shah's wife Samira for ordering the hit.[26] Rezvi later disavowed his confession.[25] On 24 February 2020, the Police Bureau of Investigation completed its investigation and reported that Salman Shah killed himself due to a family dispute over his affair with one of the most popular silver screen actresses at the time, actress Shabnur.[11]

            Salman Shah was also known for his philanthropic work, particularly in the areas of education and healthcare. He established the Salman Shah Foundation to provide scholarships and financial assistance to underprivileged students, and to support healthcare initiatives in Bangladesh.[31]
